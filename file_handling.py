Learning file handling in Python.

Opening a file in Python:
- The file must be in the same folder.
- Python provides a built-in function named open() to open a file. It returns the file object that can be used to do several file operations later.
- Syntax to open the file: file_object = open(file_name, access_mode)

Definitions:
file_object is the variable or object that is going to accept and represent the file.
file_name is one of the parameters which will contain obviously the file name and its extension. It's possible to add the absolute path of the file.
access_mode is the way the file will be opened. There are three ways to acess the file: Read Mode, Write Mode and Append Mode.

Read Mode:
r - Read-only mode, file pointer placed at the beginning of the file, default mode.
rb - Reading only in binary format, file pointer at the beginning of the file as well.
r+ - Opens a file for reading and writing. File pointer at the beginning.
rb+ - Opens a file for reading and writing in binary format. File pointer at the beginning.

Built-in methods to read a file:
read() - Reads the content until it reaches the end of the file.
read(size) - The "size" is a passed parameter in number of bytes to be read.
readline() - Reads one single line of the file at a time.
readlines() - Reads all the lines till it reaches the end of the file.

Write Mode:
w - Write-only mode. It will overwrite the file if the file exists, if not it will create a new one for writing.
wb - The same as "w" but binary.
w+ - Quite similar to "w", however it serves for writing and reading. if the file doesn't exist, it creates a new one for reading and writing.
wb+ - Also as w+, but binary.

Built-in method to write a file:
write() - It writes any string to an open file. Python string can have binary data and not just text.
file_object.write(data) - Syntax used to write the contents to a file.

Append Mode: differently from write mode that overwrite the existing file, the append mode will continue writing the data.
a - Opens a file for appending. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists, if not it creates a new one for writing.
ab - The same as "a" but binary.
a+ - Similar  to "a", but for both appending and reading. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new one for reading and writing.
ab+ - Basically a+ but binary.

Built-in method to append:
write() - just like Write Mode.

# Testing Read Mode and its methods:
archive = open("python.txt", 'r')
archive2 = open("python.txt", 'r')
archive3 = open("python.txt", 'r')
archive4 = open("python.txt", 'r')
print(archive.read())
print(archive2.read(6))
print(archive3.readline())
print(archive4.readlines())

# Testing Write Mode and its method:
archive5 = open("python2.txt", "w")
archive5.write("Python has been helping me a lot in college.")

# Testing Append Mode and its method:
archive6 = open('python2.txt', 'a')
archive6.write('\nBesides, this knowledge will help me to understand JavaScript, PHP, Dart.')

Closing a file
- It is important to close the file when the file handling is finished to free up resources.
- Python automatically closes a file when the object of a file is reassigned to another file or not in use.
- However, it is a good practice to manually close a file.

The close() method:
- A built-in method provided by Python that closes the file object.
- Syntax: file_object.close()
'''

# Closing all the files I opened:
archive.close()
archive2.close()
archive3.close()
archive4.close()
archive5.close()
archive6.close()
